        Weâ€™re a mom-and-son team sharing what we learned on the journey from
        college applications to landing a first job. No consultants, no pricey
        prep coursesâ€”just persistence, resourcefulness, and strategies that
        actually work.

    <!-- Mom -->

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 text-teal">ðŸ‘© Mom</h2>
      <p class="text-base md:text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
        Iâ€™m a stay-at-home mom who believes families donâ€™t need to spend
        thousands to succeed. From test prep to rÃ©sumÃ©s, I guided my kids
        through the process with creativity and persistence. When Iâ€™m not
        writing, youâ€™ll find me knitting, sewing, or bargain-hunting.

    <!-- Son -->

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 text-teal">ðŸ‘¨ Son</h2>
      <p class="text-base md:text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
        Iâ€™m a recent college grad now working at a big tech company. Along the
        way, I figured out how to stand out on applications and build rÃ©sumÃ©s
        that got me interviews. Now I share practical tips on admissions,
        internships, and career prep to help others avoid the hype and focus on
        what really matters.

        Sometimes we agree, sometimes we donâ€™tâ€”but thatâ€™s the fun of it. This
        blog combines a parentâ€™s perspective with a studentâ€™s real-world
        experience. Our goal: to help families, students, and young
        professionals feel confident and save money while navigating admissions,
        rÃ©sumÃ©s, and careers.
